# Traffic Navigation and Soccer AI

This project explores effective coordination strategies for multi-agent systems in two settings: traffic navigation (cars/drones) and soccer AI, leveraging heuristic control and supervised deep learning using data from Rocket League replays.

## About

We addressed coordinated actions in dynamic environmentsâ€”first, developing robust collision avoidance and navigation strategies for cars and drones in Unity, then attempting to transfer real-world soccer play data into a simulated 2D soccer AI setting. Results highlight strong navigation performance and novel data-driven soccer strategies, with discussion of pitfalls and future directions.

## Experimental Setup

- Used the Unity engine for all simulations, with agents as cars and drones across open fields and intersections.
- Traffic navigation: Employed heuristic control (collision avoidance, incremental starts, PD controllers, A* path planning) and quadrant-based intersection management.
- Soccer AI: Collected over 2,000 Rocket League pro replays via the ballchasing API. Trained a deep feed-forward network on statistical features for 3v3 gameplay; evaluated performance and analyzed transfer challenges from 3D to 2D simulation.
- Compared both domains for emergent coordination, limitations, and possible improvements.

- Sample Unity setup instructions for soccer model:  
  1. In `Packages/manifest.json` add: `"com.unity.barracuda": "2.0.0"`
  2. Place `model.onnx` in `Assets/Resources/`
  3. Run project in Unity
